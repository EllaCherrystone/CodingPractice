## Say Hello practice

The classic, absolute basic first coding practice. Simply print out the phrase "Hello, World!". Given the nature of CompleteTheFunction, your goal is to complete a function that will print out this phrase. If you want to make it a little more fun, prompt a user for their name and print it out in the same format. 

To start with, I will add just a few popular languages(C, Python, Java, and JavaScript). Feel free to make a pull request to add any other language!
