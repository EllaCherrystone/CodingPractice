# Coding Practice
I'm creating this repository in the spirit of Hacktoberfest. The 2020 Hacktoberfest will be third I've participated in and I have grown significantly as a developer since my first two. In turn, I wanted to create a repository that both new and experienced developers can add to during the month of October. The repository will be broken into three directories: CompleteTheFunction, Prompts, and Solutions. CompleteTheFunction will contain practice problems that already have an empty function and a description of what it should do and a main/driver to test the function. Prompts will simply be ideas for smaller coding projects and/or practice problems with no predefined code. Solutions are where you can commit your own solutions to the practices. My hope for this repository is that seasoned developers can help add practice problems and beginners can begin developing their skills and get an introduction into open source.

## Solution Contributions Guideline
If you're contributing to solutions you're more likely a beginner, so the first step is to familiarize yourself with making a pull request. There's a ton of tutorials that can do a much better job at explaining this than I can, so I'll just link one of the [best first contributions guide here](https://github.com/firstcontributions/first-contributions). 

1. Pick a practice problem you want to work on
2. Fork the repository
3. Clone to your machine
4. Create a new branch with the format `<username>_<practicename>`
5. Create a directory under `Solutions` with the same name as your branch
6. Get to coding! 
	1. Try to come up with your own solution at first, but if you get stuck feel free to look at other's solutions. However, any copy-pasted solutions will be marked 
7. Once you have a solution add, commit, and push your new branch
8. Make a pull request for your changes
9. Bam! Wait for any review and watch your branch get merged.
## Practice Contributions Guideline
1. Follow same steps for cloning and branching from solutions guideline.
2. If you're adding a complete the function practice:
	1. If there's more than one file to the practice, create a new directory in `CompleteTheFunction` with the name of the practice. All files needed for completing and testing the practice should be included in this directory. If you only need one file for the practice, it may be placed directly in `CompleteTheFunction`.
	2. Instructions for the practice problem should either be put in comments within the practice file or you can add a README for longer problems.
	3. For all complete the function practices you must submit a solution. Solutions follow the same naming guidelines as laid out in 2.1 and should be placed inside `Solutions/GuidedSolutions`. *Please try include comments explaining your solutions, though pull requests won't be rejected if they're missing.
3. If you're adding practice prompts:
	1. The prompts themselves should be contained in a single .txt or .md file. If you want to include files for testing, place both the prompt and test files within their own directory under `Prompts`. If you have no other files, simply add the prompt file under `Prompts`. All files should have descriptive titles.
	2. Prompts can be of two types. The first provides the coder with a specific task to complete and an expected outcome. These types of prompts should include some sort test/output, so that the coder can make sure their solution is working. The second type of prompt can be project ideas. These prompts can be much more vague and should offer some sort of practice idea that is a little more self guided. Something like "Hotel management system" is a fine example of this type of prompt. Though these ones can be more vague, please try to be at least a little descriptive of what your prompt should/can include.
	3. Prompts do not need to have solutions, but you're welcome to submit one. Follow the same solution guidelines from complete the function.
4. Once you've come up with your practice and solution (if required), add, commit, and push your branch. Make your pull request and watch out for any needed changes and wait for it to be merged.
