## Linked List Prompt

The [Linked List](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/data-structures/linked-list/) is one of the first abstract data structures that you'll learn in any computer science road map. You have a list of nodes, each of which holds some sort of data and a pointer to the next node in the list. They're one of the easier data structures and can be great for strengthen/learning your [OOP](https://www.w3schools.com/java/java_oop.asp) skills.

Some functionality to add:

- A  method for adding nodes
- One for removing nodes
- A way to traverse through the linked list (and maybe one to traverse backwards)
- A method for finding values in the linked list

Some expansions

- Implement a sorting method to efficiently sort your linked list
- Add a class to hold songs for your nodes. Put some of your favorite songs in the linked list and see if you can find a way to sort this new non-numerical data.
