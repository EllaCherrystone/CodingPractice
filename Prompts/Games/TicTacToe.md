## TicTacToe

I'm sure you already know what it is, but [TicTacToe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tic-tac-toe) is a favorite game for beginning coders to make. The logic is simple, you can make it playable from the command line, and is a fun project to finish. Once you have something functional, maybe try adding some more features, like:

- Adding a GUI(Graphical User Interface)
- Loop the game and keep track of the Win-Loss-Tie count
- Make it so the user can play against the computer
- Do an implementation of [Ultimate TicTacToe](https://mathwithbaddrawings.com/2013/06/16/ultimate-tic-tac-toe/)
