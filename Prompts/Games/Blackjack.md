## Blackjack

[Blackjack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackjack) is a classic card game. It's such a classic game, that a description feels unnecessary (still added a link, though). It is also an iconic first card game to build for new coders. It's a simple game that can be built in it's most basic form and can continually be expanded on as you grow as a programmer. For this prompt, go ahead and start building the game in it's basic form. Let the user select how many people are playing, who the dealer will be. When playing let each player bet, view their cards, decide whether or not they want another card, and determine who winds each hand. Think about what classes/objects you'll need for such a game.  What methods should each of these classes have?

Possible expansions:
  - Add functionality where the computer can act as the dealer (keep in mind the dealer will need to draw cards too, when should they stop drawing?)
     - If you want to expand even further, see how advanced/capable you can make this dealer. Can you implement a card counting one?
 - Add a GUI(Graphical User Interface) for the game
 - Looking to work with some networking? See if you can you make a multiplayer version
