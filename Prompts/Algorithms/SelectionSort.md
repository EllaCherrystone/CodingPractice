## Selection Sort

Logic wise, the [Selection Sort](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/selection-sort/) is one of the easiest ones to understand. Simply put, you find the smallest value in a data set, move it to the beginning, decrease your search area by one, and repeat until sorted (the link above can explain in more detail). If you need some data to test, why not try generating some random numbers to sort? Or perhaps you could do the [Linked List prompt](../DataStructures/LinkedList.md) and implement the sorting function for your new data structure.
